## R5:
## <span style="color:green"> Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to. Reference the chosen style guide appropriately.</span>

PEP 8 – Style Guide for Python Code

https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/

## R6:
## <span style="color:green"> Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- ###  <span style="color:green">at least THREE features
- ###  <span style="color:green">describe each feature






##  <span style="color:green">Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- ###  <span style="color:green">use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- ###  <span style="color:green">loops and conditional control structures
- ###  <span style="color:green">error handling

The features in my terminal application that i have been working on are:
- Difficulty Selection of easy, medium and hard.
- Randomly select line of text from text document depending on difficulty selected.
- Calculation of words per minute based on a timer.
- Save results in text document 
- Calculate the average based on previous recorded results saved in text file.

## R7:
<span style="color:green"> Develop an implementation plan which:
- <span style="color:green"> outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- <span style="color:green">prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- <span style="color:green">provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

<span style="color:green"> Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan.

<span style="color:green"> Provide screenshots/images and/or a reference to an accessible project management platform used to track this implementation plan. 


> <span style="color:green"> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.

## R8:
<span style="color:green"> Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

<span style="color:green"> You must include:
- <span style="color:green"> steps to install the application
- <span style="color:green"> any dependencies required by the application to operate
- <span style="color:green"> any system/hardware requirements
- <span style="color:green"> how to use any command line arguments made for the application

# Code Requirements

## R11:
<span style="color:green"> Implement features in the software development plan you have designed. You must utilise a range of programming concepts and structures using Python such as:
- <span style="color:green">variables and variable scope
- <span style="color:green">loops and conditional control structures
- <span style="color:green">write and utilise simple functions
- <span style="color:green">error handling
- <span style="color:green">input and output
- <span style="color:green">importing a Python package
- <span style="color:green">using functions from a Python package

## R12:
<span style="color:green"> Apply DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) coding principles to all code produced.

## R13:
<span style="color:green">Apply all style and conventions for the programming language consistently to all code produced.

## R14:
<span style="color:green"> Creates an application which runs without error and has features that are consistent with the development plan.

## R15:
<span style="color:green">Design TWO tests which check that the application is running as expected.

<span style="color:green">Each test should:
- <span style="color:green">cover a different feature of the application
- <span style="color:green">state what is being tested
- <span style="color:green">provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case

> <span style="color:green">An outline of the testing procedure and cases should be included with the source code of the application

## Manual Test Plan located in: ./docs/MatthewBeale_T1A3testplan.xlsx


## R16:
<span style="color:green">Utilise source control throughout the development of the application by:
- <span style="color:green">making regular commits (at least 20 commits) with a commit message that summarises the changes
- <span style="color:green">pushing all commits to a remote repository

## [Github Repo](https://github.com/mttble/MatthewBeale_T1A3)

## R17:
<span style="color:green">Utilise developer tools to facilitate the execution of the application:
For example,
- <span style="color:green">writing a script which turns the application into an executable
## [Bash Script](./src/typethis.sh)
